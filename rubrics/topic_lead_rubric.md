# Grading rubric for discussion lead of a recent literature article
On Thursday's, small groups will lead a discussion of a recent literature
article of their choosing based on the week's topic. Your grade will be based on your
ability to introduce the topic, generate discussion amongst the class, and respond to
any questions the class may have.

## Paper introduction (5 points)
When introducing the paper, you should provide a summary of the article and it's main
findings.
You should also place the results of the article in context of previous research in the
field (this can include things we have talked about earlier in class).
To summarize the findings and context, you may want to use visuals, such as
slides or drawings on the white board.

## Discussion generation (10 points)
You may use any tools you'd like to generate discussion. This can include individual,
small group, or full class activities. However, the discussion must ultimately be coherent
and address points of interest developed by you or the class. Note: you will need to get
things moving if the discussion goes stale.

## Responses to class questions (5 points)
You may be asked to clarify portions of the paper. As such, please familiarize yourself
with the methods and important literature cited within the article you choose.
