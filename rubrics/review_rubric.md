# Grading rubric for final review paper and oral presentation
As mentioned in the syllabus,
the primary semester project will be to produce a literature review paper. 
Broadly, the review paper should address a question or problem related 
to ecosystem ecology.
The review should be forward thinking, in that it forms the
basis for understanding ecosystem processes, including responses and/or feedbacks,
moving forward.
The review will be assessed for completeness, breadth, originality, scientific rigor 
and presentation.
The description and scoring for each of these components is laid out below.
Both the review paper and oral presentation will be graded for the same elements.

## Structure
**All papers must include a cover page with the title, authors, and 
a statement defining the intended audience.**

**All papers must include a one-page summary of the project that
includes a statement of the problem or question addressed, the method it was
addressed, and a statement of the main conclusions from the project.**

In all cases literature must be cited in a consistent format. Please use peer-reviewed
literature articles. Non-peer-reviewed literature may be used under select circumstances,
but only if a peer-reviewed article cannot be used in its place.

### Description of a successful literature review
Literature reviews should address a single question or problem. The documents should
thoroughly review the scientific studies done to address this question/problem as well
as document any gaps in the literature that may deserve further attention. A successful
review will pull together multiple research areas and present the findings around a
central theme as a way to guide future research. Important terms may be defined in 
a glossary and important concepts may be fleshed out in boxes. Conceptual diagrams and
figures may be useful. Note that these can be redrawn from other articles provided that
proper citation is given.
**Note: Reviews should review a problem or question, not a single paper!**
An expanded description of a successful literature review can be found in the
[Literature_Review folder](../Lit_review/literature_review_description.md)

## Grading Rubric (100 points total)
Both the review paper and oral presentation will be graded using the rubric below.
The oral presentation should address the primary insights and findings from the review
paper, but does not need to cover all the information from the paper.
As such, the oral presentation will test your ability to summarize the main findings without
sacrificing the quality of the work.

### Completeness (30 points)
The review begins with a logical introduction that includes a statement of the
problem or question asked. The main portion of the review address the problem
or question. The review ends with an answer to the problem or question, or a 
path to address the problem or question. The audience must be convinced that the
problem is important and was (or can be) addressed.

### Breadth and Originality (20 points)
The review is sufficiently broad to address an outstanding question in the field
of plant physiological ecology. The review should can combine known ideas to form
a new idea, but must not be a simple reiteration of known facts.

### Scientific rigor (30 points)
The review should be grounded in sound science. The product should not contain false
or ambiguous claims. The development of testable predictions and/or hypotheses is
strongly encouraged. All unoriginal facts and figures should be correctly cited.

### Presentation (20 points)
The review should be presented in a clear, concise manner appropriate for the
defined audience. All documents should use proper English grammar and notation. 
All figures and images should be clearly presented
with all elements fully defined. The review paper should have all information in writing.
In the oral presentation, elements can be verbally described and/or described using slides.
In the oral presentation, please try to avoid adding excessive text that can be conveyed verbally.
