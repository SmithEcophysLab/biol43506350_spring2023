# Grading rubric for discussion lead of a recent literature article
For each class, students will be assigned a reading from either the book or primary literature. 
Typically, on Tuesday's this will consist of a "classic" literature article and on Thursday's
this will be a more contemporary article. Students will be asked to read and provide a written
summary of the article during the corresponding class. The summary should consist of
a 1 paragraph summary that clearly shows that the student read the article as well
as 2 questions that the student developed while reading the article.


## Paper summary (5 points)
The one paragraph summary should summarize the article in the students own words. It should
not just paraphrase the Abstract. The student should state the main purpose of the article
as well as the main points or results brought forth as well as the primary conclusions
made by the authors.

## Questions (5 points)
The student should generate at least 2 questions based on the reading. These should be either
clarification or bigger picture questions. Students are strongly encouraged to ask
these questions during the discussion of the papers.
