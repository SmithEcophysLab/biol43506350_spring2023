# Grading rubric for review paper proposal
The purpose of the review paper proposal is to write up your idea
as a way to receive feedback and, ultimately, improve your project.
This will involve a short, written idea for the review. The proposal will be
reviewed by Dr. Smith and a student (grads) or group (undergrads) in the class. 

Please refer to the [literature review description]('../Literature_Review/literature_review_description.md')
for further assistance.
