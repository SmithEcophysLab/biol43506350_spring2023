\BOOKMARK [1][-]{section.3}{With climate change, precipitation patterns are expected to become more variable, with stronger individual events coupled with greater time periods in between events. Propose a hypothesis for how you might expect these effects to influence plant form and functioning at the individual scale.}{}% 3
