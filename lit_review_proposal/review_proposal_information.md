# Information about review proposals

### Objective
The objective of the review proposals is for each student or group to present their
idea and get feedback from Dr. Smith and their fellow classmates. Dr. Smith will provide
feedback on the written and oral proposal. The class will provide feedback on the
oral proposal. Dr. Smith will collate all student feedback for each student or group.

### Format
The format will consist of a short written proposal (2-3 pages) and short oral presentation
on the proposal (~5 minutes). More information can be found in the [rubric](../Rubrics/review_proposal_rubric.md).

### Grading
Both the written and oral proposal will be graded. Please refer to the 
[rubric](../Rubrics/review_proposal_rubric.md) for more information and contact Dr. Smith
if you have additional questions.

### Schedule
The schedule will be randomly assigned with graduate students presenting first,
followed by undergraduate students. The full schedule will be posted [here](review_proposal_schedule.md).
